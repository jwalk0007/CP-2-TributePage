     <h3>A brief history</h3>
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Frisbee</strong> - Headrick patented the now well known frisbee design. He also founded the IFA (International Frisbee Association) and began filming commercials to promote frisbee games and sports.</li>
<br>
    <li><strong>Disc Golf</strong> - "Steady" Ed coined and trademarked the term "Disc Golf" and in 1976, the DGA (Disc Golf Association) was born. Rules were established and the game was promoted across the country.</li>
    <br>

    <li><strong>Disc Golf Basket</strong> - In 1977, Headrick and his son Ken developed the first modern disc catching device. The patented "Disc Pole Hole" is now used in the majority of over 7,000 disc golf courses installed throughout the world.</li>
